#Instructions
An 8 ball answer generator is a mechanism that gives randomized replies based on questions you insert into it. People sometimes use it as a fun way to make minor decisions. What I've made is an 8 ball generator that allows users to put questions into it, and then gives them an answer. To use it, paste the backend coding in the other repository file, into the site that will be listed in this README file. Run the code and ask the 8ball whatever it is you want. Remember to paste the entire code in the 8ball file into https://www.online-python.com/online_python_compiler or a similar site. Visual Studio Code also works if its installed on your PC. Press the Run Code button on the website (it should look like a play button) and you will get the result.Enjoy!
#Challenges
This repository didn't offer many challenges, but what it did remind me is that efficient code doesn't have to be very long, and that Python can do a lot of things for a little depending on what it is you're trying to do.
